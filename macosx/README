Previous Releases:

1.13.0

* Added support for Japanese Black 2 / White 2 on DSi / XL / 3DS.
* Added Dream Radar support.
* Added Hidden Hollow generation support.
* Added support for shiny charm in Standard Seed Searcher.
* Added support for the effects of the having done a memory link with a
  Black / White game.  This affects the initial PID frame and also has a small
  effect on Dream Radar.
* Added a larger seed cache to cover a number of different scenarios.  This has
  increased the application size by about 10 megabytes.
  * Standard Seed search is fastest within the first 6 IV frames.
  * Faster searching is supported up to IV frame 100 for Black 2 / White 2 and
    frame 102 for Black / White.  This includes C-Gear seeds for Black 2 and
    White 2.
  * Instant search for Black / White C-Gear seeds is supported up to frame 100.
  * Faster search for Dream Radar seeds is supported up to frame 40 for slot 1.
* Fixed the broken CSV output functionality.
* Fixed a bug in the calculaion of the expected number of results in the 4th
  Gen seed searcher.
* All table columns can now be resized.

1.12.0

* Added support for Japanese Black 2 / White 2 on DS / DS Lite.
  * Except for C-Gear seed searches, all Gen 5 RNG abuse types supported for
    Black / White should also work for Black 2 / White 2.
  * On Japanese Black 2 / White 2 retail cartridges Timer0 shows more variance
    than in Black / White, having up to 6 different values.  The use of an
    external timer (eg. a stopwatch) is highly recommended to avoid frustration.
  * In Black 2 / White 2, C-Gear seeds are not used.  Turning on the C-Gear just
    advances the Standard Seed IV frame by 2 instead of reseeding the IV RNG as
    in Black / White.
* Added support for double grass encounters.  At this time, only the Pokemon on
  the right side of a double battle can be RNG abused.
* Changed the way that configurations are handled in the Gen 5 seed inspectors
  to eliminate the need to create a new configuration in order to inspect the
  details of a seed.
* Fixed a bug that would produce wrong results when starting a search from
  Janurary 1, 2000.

1.11.1

* Bug fix for a display issue with the Gen 4 Egg IV Searcher.

1.11.0

* Added 4th Generation breeding support with the Egg PID and Egg IV searchers,
  and corresponding tabs in the Generation 4 Seed Inspector
* Seed / frame details now filled in automatically when opening the Gen 4 Seed
  Inspector from a Gen 4 seed searcher
* Added Chatot pitch info to Gen 4 Seed Inspector

Known Issues in this version:

* Aside from the C-Gear Seed Inspector, none of the 'Find' or 'Save' buttons in
  the seed inspectors work. For now, you'll just have to scroll through
  manually. 'Save' buttons in the searcher windows should properly save CSV
  files of the results.
* Copy / Paste will work on specific fields that you can type in, but at the
  moment you can't copy other things such as result rows.
* There is not much in the way of argument checking. If you set a minimum IV
  that is greater than the corresponding maximum IV, it will try very hard to
  find that impossible IV spread.
* There is some funny behavior when editing the DS / Game Config with multiple
  windows open. The selected config in other windows appears to change. It is a
  minor annoyance, but for now just set your config again in the other window
  from it's drop down menu. Down the line there will be a bit of an interface
  change to deal with this.


1.10.0

Added:
* Added support for other encounter lead abilities in Gen 5 such as Cute Charm
  and Suction Cups
* Standard Seed Searcher now clearly shows which types of encounters are
  possible on which frames for a given shiny seed and allows filtering on
  desired encounter types
* Added proper Entralink PID generation and frame timing to Standard Seed
  Inspector
* Added instant search for standard IV patterns on Entralink frames 21-26 to
  C-Gear Seed Searcher
* Added Entralink Nature Search to C-Gear Seed Inspector
* 5th Gen Egg Seed Searcher now allows for the use of an optional seed cache
  file, which allows searches to run in 1/3rd of the time normally required.
  To use this, download the separate eggseeds.dat file and place it in the same
  folder as PPRNG.
* Added Chatot pitch info to Standard Seed Inspector and Wonder Card Seed
  Inspector
* Standard Seed Inspector now shows which item will be found in Swirling Dust
  and Bridge Shadows when they are not encounters (distribution of Everstone and
  King's Rock may not be correct, but others should be)
* Wonder Card Seed Searcher & Inspector now support full specification of Wonder
  Card parameters to ensure that the PID is correctly generated
* Wonder Card Seed Searcher now supports searching for shinies for those cards
  which allow it
* Seed / frame details now filled in automatically when opening the seed
  inspectors from the seed searchers for Standard Seeds, Egg Seeds, Wonder
  Cards, and CGear Seeds for both IVs and Entralink Natures
* Added support for Italian games on DSi / 3DS.  Only the Korean games are not
  currently supported on DSi/XL/3DS.

Updated:
* Unset Parent IVs in the Egg Seed Searcher and Standard Seed Inspector's Eggs
  tab no longer result in a 0 IV, instead giving an indication of which parent
  is passing on the IV and preventing a potentially large number of false
  positives when searching for Trick Room seeds
* Fishing encounter slots now properly separated from Surfing encounter slots
* Multiple natures can now be searched simultaneously in Gen 5
* Trainer ID Searcher now gives a clearer indication of what kinds of encounters
  are possible for a chosen PID frame from a given seed
* Very small speed optimization for hashed seeds

Fixed:
* Fixed issue in Gen 5 Config panel where a config using a DS Phat did not
  display the DS type correctly
* Fixed an issue with the way that the IV search parameters checked for IV
  patterns which could disable the faster searches unnecessarily
* Edits in the current text cell are now properly recognized when a search is
  started

1.9.0

* The Standard Seed Searcher is now 75% faster than before for all common
  searches.  As long as you choose one of the IV patterns from the drop down
  menu (you can still set more specific IVs for, for example, a specific hidden
  power) and you are searching within the first 6 IV frames (there is not much
  reason to search for other frames unless you really want something on a
  particular date), you will benefit from the fact that PPRNG has all useful
  seeds of these types precalculated.  This reduces the search time for a 30-day
  month with up to 3 key presses on my 2008 Mac Book Pro (2 cores) from 35
  minutes to 9 minutes.  If you choose to search with other parameters, PPRNG
  will revert to the slower (though still relatively fast!) search.
* Support for French and Spanish games on DSi/3DS added.
* Wonder Card and Egg Seed searches experienced minor speed increases.
* Fixed a bug in the CGear IV generation code that caused slightly wrong IVs to
  be generated for the first 6 frames.
* Fixed a crash that occurred when opening any of the windows before setting a
  DS Type in the configuration.
* Fixed the problem with the Standard Seed Searcher not opening in OS 10.5.
* Made various cosmetic and behind-the-scenes code changes to clean up the
  project code base in preparation for source release.

1.8.2

* Added Swarm frame support in the Standard Seed Searcher and Inspector.
* Added support for Korean games on DS and DS Lite.
* Added support for German games on DSi and 3DS.
* The Standard Seed Searcher columns are now adjustable and the window width can
  be resized.  There is too much data to display for me to try to cram it into a
  fixed size.  There is no saving of column widths or window size, however.
* Fixed the automatic check for updates that I broke in 1.8.0.  Please spread
  the word to fellow PPRNG users about this update, since they won't get the
  automatic notification this time.

1.8.0

* DSi, DSi XL, and 3DS users can now do Standard Seed RNG on English and
  Japanese language games.  We hope to get other languages soon.  Make sure you
  set your DS model correctly in your configuration.
* Added the 4th Generation Seed Inspector, and rewrote the 4th Generation Seed
  Searcher to use Wichu's instant search algorithm.  There are now also
  separate configurations for 4th Generation games.
* Searches based on Standard Seeds (including Wonder Cards and Breeding) have
  received another speed increase.  For example, on my 2008 Mac Book Pro (2
  cores), searching all key combinations took 1 minute 37 seconds for a single
  date, and about 48 minutes for a full month.  With this update running on the
  same machine, it now takes 1 minute 10 seconds for a single day, or 35 minutes
  for a whole month, which is more than 25% less than version 1.5.0.  Users with
  better machines than mine will see less drastic improvement, but it will still
  be faster.
* Numerous tweaks have been done behind the scenes.

While the above list appears short, a lot has changed under the hood, so it's
possible that I've broken something that used to work.


1.5.0
General
* Searching for Standard Seeds, Wonder Card Seeds, and Egg Seeds is now multi-
  threaded.  One thread for each processor on the machine will be created,
  meaning that searching will be potentially be multiple times faster.  If you
  run multiple searches simultaneously, search time will be impacted because
  there will be more threads running than processors.
* The search algorithm speed for Standard Seeds and Egg Seeds has been improved,
  in addition to the threading above.  Combined with the threading, most users
  will see searches running at least twice as fast as before.  As an example,
  searching in the Standard Seed Searcher on IV frames 1-5 for a single day
  with all buttons checked and two Timer0 values takes 5 minutes 46 seconds for
  me in version 1.2.0 on my 2.53 GHz Core 2 Due with 4GB Mac Book Pro (late
  2008).  In 1.5.0 it takes 1 minute 37 seconds.  Multiplied out to a full
  month's search, what used to take 2 hours and 53 minutes now takes 48 minutes
  30 seconds.
* All searchers and inspectors now handle the initial PID frame offsets, for
  example displaying the initial frame number and only considering results
  starting from the initial frame number.  Adjacent frames are generated using
  the same offset from the initial PID frame so as to more likely provide
  accurate and useful adjacents.
* Each gender ratio now has its own column to make clear which ratio is which
  gender.
* Many searchers and inspectors now have tool tips to help explain the meaning
  of some of the less obvious columns and settings.  Hover over fields, column
  headings, etc. to see their meaning.  Note that not all tool tips have been
  added at this time, though the Standard Seed Searcher is complete.
* Some better argument is starting to be added, though it is still incomplete.
* PPRNG will now check for updates when you run it.  Hopefully fewer people will
  be stuck on old versions in the future.

Standard Seeds
* Many more filtering options have been added to the Standard Seed Searcher.
  Note that PID frame-related fitlers do not have a significant effect on the
  search time because the majority of the search time is taken finding the IV
  frames.  These filters are there because many people dislike having to sift
  through results.  At the moment these filters are not taken into account when
  estimating the number of results that will be produced.
* The Egg Seed Searcher and Eggs tab now handle the special parents Nidoran-F
  and Illumise.
* It is now possible to search for Eggs based on the desired Species or Gender.
* The Hidden Power column was added back to the Eggs tab.

Wonder Cards
* The searcher and inspector now allow for the user to enter details of the
  Wonder Card which may affect how the frames are generated.  At the moment, it
  has defaults for the two known card types, but it is possible to edit the
  specific details using the custom setting if a new type of card is released.
  All currently available cards are handled by the 'Standard' card except for
  the two shiny cards released in Japan which are covered by the 'Shiny' card.
* The Wonder Card Seed Inspector now shows Characteristics.

C-Gear Seeds
* The C-Gear Seed Inspector now allows for searching within the list of frames,
  which is very helpful when using the Adjacents tab to try and find what delay
  and frame you actually hit.

There are probably some other changes that I have forgotten in this big update.

1.2.0
* Initial Egg Seed Searcher added.  It isn't always accurate when calculating
  how many expected results there will be, but it shouldn't prevent you from
  running reasonable searches.  In some cases you can run searches that will
  return way too many results.
* Added Characteristic to the Adjacents Tab of the Standard Seed Inspector.
* Updated wild encounter PID generation to use the newest researched algorithm.
* Fixed a bug where you couldn't have an ID or SID of 0 (again).
* Fixed a bug where the searches would get stuck if there were too few seeds
  being considered (most commonly seen in the ID Frame Search tab).
* Various minor cosmetic changes.  Most notable is that shiny is now indicated
  with a star instead of '!!!' (because I felt like it).

1.1.5
* Added Characteristic calculation for egg frames if you supply the IV frame
  number and the IVs of both parents.  This is helpful for locating which frame
  you landed on.
* Fixed (hopefully) incorrect egg frame generation.
* Removed the ES (everstone) column from the egg tab of the Standard Seed
  Inspector.  If breeding with an everstone, the nature will be replaced with
  <ES> if the everstone takes effect.
* Added columns for held item, fishing success, and dust/shadow item to the
  PID frame section of the Standard Seed Searcher.
* Added a switch for when the first pokemon in your party has the ability
  Compound Eyes to the PID frame section of the Standard Seed Inspector. This
  has a small effect on how the frame is generated, but most importantly it has
  an effect on the item that a wild Pokemon holds (if it holds any at all).
* Added columns for fishing success and dust/shadow encounter to the Trainer ID
  searcher so that you can know whether your shiny PID will allow you to fish
  and / or find a Pokemon in swirling dust / bridge shadows.
* Fixed a bug where you couldn't have an ID / SID of 0.
* Fixed a bug where you couldn't type into the Hidden Power minimum power field.

1.1.0:
* ID/SID Abuse - See Trainer ID Searcher
* DS Parameter Searcher now uses the MAC address from your configuration.
* Min PID frame for shiny search in Standard Seed Searcher
* Better estimation of the number of results (now considers HP type, shininess)

1.0.5:
* Added Stationary Encounter frame type to cover encounters such as Coballion.
* Various minor GUI fixes.

1.0.4
* Bugfix for incorrect Encounter Slot calculation.
* Added Sync and ESV columns to shiny section of the Standard Seed Searcher.

1.0.3
Fixed a bug causing the Standard Seed Searcher to not display shiny PID frame
information.

1.0.2
Actual fix for OS X 10.5 issues.
